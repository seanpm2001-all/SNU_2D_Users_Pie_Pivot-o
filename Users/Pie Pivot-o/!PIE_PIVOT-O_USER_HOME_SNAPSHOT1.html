<H2>Compilation of all of his videos made by Sean Myrick</H2>
<H2>February 20th 2019</H2>
<H3>Watch all his videos again and remember him. Unfortunately, we cannot change what happened. It felt really close when he died. It was really sad. He had so much potential, but due to YouTube and his abusive family, we had that taken away from us</H3>
<H3>I didn't know him personally, but he seemed like a really nice person. Abuse is hard, and no-one deserves it... well except for some "people" like Hitler, but that is besides the point. We lost an important person today. He was only a child.</H3>
<H3>Suicide is a way out, but it isn't the right way. Even at your lowest, there is always a chance that it can get better for you. When you commit suicide, you get away from the troubles, but you leave everyone to suffer</H3>
